\arguments{
\item{stream}{character; The stream name. The stream name must
match a stream name in `ReachName` field in the
other parameters.}

\item{flowline_fc}{character; The path to a `flowline` feature class.}

\item{xs_fc}{character; The path to the cross section feature
class.}

\item{xs_dims_fc}{character; The path to the "xs_dims" feature class.}

\item{xs_points_1}{character; The path to a `xs_points` feature
class for the "base year".}

\item{xs_points_2}{character; The path to a `xs_points` feature
class for the second time period.}

\item{xs_points_3}{character; The path to a `xs_points` feature
class for the third time period.}

\item{xs_points_4}{character; The path to a `xs_points` feature
class for the fourth time period.}

\item{survey_name_1}{character: The name or date of the "base year"
survey.}

\item{survey_name_2}{character: The name or date of the second survey.}

\item{survey_name_3}{character: The name or date of the third survey.}

\item{survey_name_4}{character: The name or date of the fourth survey.}

\item{dem}{character; The path to the DEM raster.}

\item{banklines_fc}{character: the path to the banklines feature class.}

\item{features_fc}{character; The path to a `features` feature class.}

\item{bf_estimate}{numeric; Detrended bankfull estimate (units:
detrended feet).}

\item{regions}{character vector; Regions to calculate hydraulic
dimensions for. See the `RegionalCurve` package for
a list of regions.}

\item{label_xs}{logical; Label cross sections?}

\item{show_xs_map}{logical; Add the cross section maps to the report?}

\item{profile_units}{character; the units of the longitudinal profile.
One of "kilometers", "meters", "miles", or "feet".}

\item{aerial}{logical; Display an overview map with an aerial
photo background?}

\item{elevation}{logical; Display an overview map with an elevation
background?}

\item{xs_label_freq}{numeric; An integer indicating the frequency of
cross section labels.}

\item{exaggeration}{numeric; The degree of terrain exaggeration.}

\item{extent_factor}{numeric; The amount the extent is expanded around
the cross section feature class. Values greater
than one zoom out, values less than one zoom in.}

\item{output_dir}{character; The path to the folder in which to
write the report.}

\item{output_format}{character; The file format of the report. One of
"html_document", "word_document", "pdf_document".}
