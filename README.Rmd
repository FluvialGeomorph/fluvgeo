## Description
This package contains a wide range of functions for performing fluvial 
geomorphic analysis. This package is designed for use with the FluvialGeomorph 
Python package. The FluvialGeomorph package contains an ArcGIS toolbox that can 
be used to extract spatial data from high-resolution terrain data. 
FluvialGeomorph uses functions in this package to perform a wide range of 
fluvial geomorphic analysis:

* derive synthetic stream channel dimensions
* derive stream planform dimensions
* help choose a bankfull elevation for ungaged streams

## Funding
Funding for development and maintenance of `fluvgeo` was provided by the US Army 
Corps of Engineers (USACE) [Ecosystem Management and Restoration
Research Program (EMRRP)](https://emrrp.el.erdc.dren.mil). <img src="man/figures/EMRRP_logo_300.png" align="right" />
