## Description
This package contains a wide range of functions for performing fluvial 
geomorphic analysis. This `R` package is designed for use with the [FluvialGeomorph 
ArcGIS toolbox](https://github.com/FluvialGeomorph/FluvialGeomorph). The FluvialGeomorph ArcGIS toolbox contains an tools that can be used to extract spatial data from high-resolution terrain data. The FluvialGeomorph ArcGIS toolbox depends on functions in this package to perform a wide range of fluvial geomorphic analysis:

* Calculate stream channel dimensions
* Calculate stream planform dimensions
* Produce reports of stream channel and planform dimensions
* Tools for choosing a bankfull elevation for ungaged streams

## Funding
Funding for development and maintenance of `fluvgeo` was provided by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE):

* [Ecosystem Management and Restoration Research Program (EMRRP)](https://emrrp.el.erdc.dren.mil).
