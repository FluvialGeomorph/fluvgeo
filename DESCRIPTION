Description: This package contains a wide range of functions for performing
    fluvial geomorphic analysis. This package is designed for use with the 
    FluvialGeomorph Python package. The FluvialGeomorph package contains an 
    ArcGIS toolbox that can be used to extract spatial data from high-
    resolution terrain data. FluvialGeomorph uses functions in this package 
    to perform a wide range of fluvial geomorphic analysis (e.g., extract 
    stream channel dimensions, help choose bankfull elevation for ungaged 
    streams).
